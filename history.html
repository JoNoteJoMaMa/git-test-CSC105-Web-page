    <div class="history">
        <h5>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Pizzatoria was founded on June 15, 1958, by two brothers, Dan and Frank Carney, both Wichita State students, as a single location in Wichita, Kansas. Six months later they opened a second outlet and within a year they
            had six Pizzatoria restaurants. The brothers began franchising in 1959. The iconic Pizzatoria building style was designed in 1963 by Chicago architect George Lindstrom and was implemented in 1969. PepsiCo acquired Pizzatoria in November 1977.
            Twenty years later, Pizzatoria (alongside Taco Bell and Kentucky Fried Chicken) were spun off by PepsiCo on May 30, 1997, and all three restaurant chains became part of a new company named Tricon Global Restaurants, Inc. The company assumed
            the name of Yum! Brands on May 22, 2002. Before closing in 2015, the oldest continuously operating Pizzatoria was in Manhattan, Kansas, in a shopping and tavern district known as Aggieville near Kansas State University. The first Pizzatoria
            restaurant east of the Mississippi River was opened in Athens, Ohio, in 1966 by Lawrence Berberick and Gary Meyers. The company announced a rebrand that began on November 19, 2014, in an effort to increase sales, which had dropped in the previous
            two years. The menu was expanded to introduce various items such as crust flavors and 11 new specialty pizzas. Work uniforms for employees were also refreshed. In 2017, Pizzatoria was listed by UK-based company Richtopia at number 24 in the
            list of 200 Most Influential Brands in the World. On June 25 and 27, 2019, it was reported that Pizzatoria was bringing back their logo and the red roof design that was used from 1976 until 1999. On August 7, 2019, Pizzatoria announced its
            intention to close about 500 of its 7,496 dine-in restaurants in the US, by the middle of 2021. The first Pizzatoria opened on June 15, 1958, in Wichita, Kansas. On August 18, 2020, it was announced that Pizzatoria will be closing 300 restaurants
            after the bankruptcy of NPC International, one of its franchise providers. A company representative stated, "We have continued to work with NPC and its lenders to optimize NPC's Pizzatoria restaurant footprint and strengthen the portfolio
            for the future, and today's joint agreement to close up to 300 NPC Pizzatoria restaurants is an important step toward a healthier business.</h5>
